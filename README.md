# Hey, I'm Will! And I love software!

Welcome to my profile! My name is Will and I am a very idea and passion driven person when it comes to working on my own or other people's projects where I believe there is lots of potential and area to express my skills and abilities in what I like doing best.
Most of the time, you will find me working on a project on GitHub but outside of that time, I am either taking photos with my camera or touring around Switzerland.

- I have been doing photography for about 2 years in my free time as a hobby. I use the Canon M50 with a 15-50MM lens and a 55-200MM lens. Most people really like my photos and you can find most of them on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/willdotchill/).
- Always been facinated by servers and the entire infrastructure behind them. I have spent a lot of time building them and breaking them (on a software level) and expanding my understanding of them.
- Alongside servers, I have started learning about the more complicated and advanced side of networking and how all the componenets communicate with one another.
