# Projects

**Active Projects**

- College Homework Tracker (Private Repo); I have worked on a College Homework
tracker that effectively allows college students to track there work with all
  sorts of other features such as timetable tracking. This is created with the
  Laravel framework which I really like. Once I finish it, I plan to attach it to a domain
  and have it hosted on Laravel Vapor on AWS. The repo is currently private as
  I use Nova which is not allowed to be shared freely. This is one of my
  long term projects that I hope to finish.
  
- Spotify Tailwind Edition (Public Repo); This is just a side project that I felt
like I wanted to do. I took inspiration from the recent overhaul spotify has had and
  since Tailwind is quite modern and simplistic thought I would try and redesign it.
  This is purely to allow me to practice using Tailwind, I have no other intentions for it.
  
- Pizza Ordering Application (Public Repo, College); This is something that I had to do at college
which was fun and allowed me to use my C# skills on Visual Studio allowing me to build an application for
  an interpreted client.
  
- Tailwind and Laravel Template (Public Repo); Since I use Laravel and Tailwind so much and have a folder
full of projects that I am currently working on, I decided it would be useful to me and everyone else
  to have a template that I can just take and use whenever I need instead of messing around installing it
  all again and configuring it.
  
**Planned Projects**

- Artifical Wayne (Private repo); This is still undergoing planning but I hope to build a discord bot that will take the 
place of the old discord server owner who had to leave. This server is for college use only so don't ask me for an invite, I'm now to the owner.

- Student Portal (Public repo); This is also being planned currently. It will hopefully, maybe one day, replace the current college
student portal giving students access to all the resources that they need. Using Laravel framework and Tailwind for a refreshed
design and look which I think would be awesome. Maybe get it done near September 2021.

- Personal Photography Platform; Using the Laravel Framework and Tailwind, I want to make a platform
that I can place all my photos onto using the Nova backend for admin management and showcase my work
  to the world. I might integrate some kind of purchasing system but it was not really my intention
  to earn anything from my photography skills. I am yet to improve anyway.
  
**Private Projects**

- Shhh, they are private!
- I have a lot of them (10)
