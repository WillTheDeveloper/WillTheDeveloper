#Projects

**Active Projects**

- College Homework Tracker (Private Repo); I have worked on a College Homework
tracker that effectively allows college students to track there work with all
  sorts of other features such as timetable tracking. This is created with the
  Laravel framework which I really like. Once I finish it, I plan to attach it to a domain
  and have it hosted on Laravel Vapor on AWS. The repo is currently private as
  I use Nova which is not allowed to be shared freely. This is one of my
  long term projects that I hope to finish.
  
- Spotify Tailwind Edition (Public Repo); This is just a side project that I felt
like I wanted to do. I took inspiration from the recent overhaul spotify has had and
  since Tailwind is quite modern and simplistic thought I would try and redesign it.
  This is purely to allow me to practice using Tailwind, I have no other intentions for it.
  
- Pizza Ordering Application (Public Repo, College); This is something that I had to do at college
which was fun and allowed me to use my C# skills on Visual Studio allowing me to build an application for
  an interpreted client.
  
- Tailwind and Laravel Template (Public Repo); Since I use Laravel and Tailwind so much and have a folder
full of projects that I am currently working on, I decided it would be useful to me and everyone else
  to have a template that I can just take and use whenever I need instead of messing around installing it
  all again and configuring it.
  
**Planned Projects**

- Personal Photography Platform; Using the Laravel Framework and Tailwind, I want to make a platform
that I can place all my photos onto using the Nova backend for admin management and showcase my work
  to the world. I might integrate some kind of purchasing system but it was not really my intention
  to earn anything from my photography skills. I am yet to improve anyway.
  
**Private Projects**

- Shhh, they are private!
- I have a lot of them (10)

#Experience

- I know quite a lot about C#: Spent a few months learning it.

- *This list would be very long but other things are not that important*
