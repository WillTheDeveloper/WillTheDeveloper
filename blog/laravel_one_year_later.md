# Laravel one year later

## What is Laravel?

Laravel is a PHP framework that is orignally made from Taylor Otwell. Over the years, they have developed the main front facing appliation that most people would call just a website but then they have come out with additional smaller packages to build an ecosystem that allows you to do all different sorts of things. A good example being, an entire backend that could be used to assist you when your managing dynamic content on your website, such as a blog where people post things and comment on each others content.

## Why did I use it?

Initially, I had started using it due to a work placement that I did during college where we was tasked to learn and understand this huge framework. Initially, it was quite daunting because the first time I looked at the documentation, I honestly thought I was learning a new programming language because all I really saw at a glance was snippets of code. At the time I started learning the framework, they had loads of packages that did different things that you could cherry pick from to implement into your application which extended the time it took to grasp a full understanding of what does what as a baseline understanding of it.
