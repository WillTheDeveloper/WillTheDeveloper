## What is Laravel?

Laravel is a PHP framework that is orignally made from Taylor Otwell. Over the years, they have developed the main front facing appliation that most people would call just a website but then they have come out with additional smaller packages to build an ecosystem that allows you to do all different sorts of things. A good example being, an entire backend that could be used to assist you when your managing dynamic content on your website, such as a blog where people post things and comment on each others content.
