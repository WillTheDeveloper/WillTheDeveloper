# Me and my photograghy journey

## How it all started (Jan 2020)

If you want to know the truth, the short story of how this all started is when simply; my dad bought a camera. But never really used it. A little bit of context but nobody in my family as I know it, has ever done photography, studied it or done it. Just for the people who don't know me but I have never studied it or took any courses on it.
